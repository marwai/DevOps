* create at least two files to use parent classes
* use super().__init__
* use sudo code
* This files demonstrates the use of inheritance 
* The new class is called derived(or child) class and the one from which it inherits

```
* The exercise focused on the 4 pillars. The foundation of the 4 pillars is inheritance. Inheritance is the act of calling
the attributes and functionalities from one class to another. In this case the class Animal is the parent class of 
reptile, reptile parent of snake and snake parent of python. Making Animal the great grand parent class of python. Python
inherits all the funcitionalaties of snake, snake inherits reptile and so on, This is called inheritance.Encapsulation is important to prevent variables from being changed by setting them as private or protected.
To make a class private dunder (double underscore) is used.
