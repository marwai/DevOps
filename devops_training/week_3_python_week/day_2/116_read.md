### Abstraction
```bash 
when using methods in our code

def bark(self):
    return "woof"
modelling class 
print(fido.bark())

when you want to hide the complexity so the simplicity on the surface is simple in the child class
```

### Inheritance
``` bash
Animal - from animal class inherited:
attributes and functionalities

snake inherited everything the Animal class
from animal import Animal 
```
def __init__(self):
    super.init() # super refers to the parent/base class   
    
snake(Animal)
print(animal.sleep())

## Polymorphism
``` bash
When a new object is created, it inherits as well as overrides particular attributes or behaviour without affecting 
the classes 

```
## Encapsulation 
``` bash 
Making variables or methods private to hide various aspects of a class from  a user

def __sleep():
```
### Definitions
* Instansiation and initialisation
```
When you instantiate a class or object, you're creating a new instance of it, or allocating memory to "hold" one. 
Initializing that object would be the instructions that are performed during instantiation
