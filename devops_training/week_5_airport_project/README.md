## Criteria

**Agile Breakdown**
```
Products are typically described by hundreds of requirements which are organized in the product backlog. Theme or epics
 cannot be completed in one sprint so they are broken into more user stories and subsequently a group of related tasks. 
Epics are then delivered in releases. But even small user stories from different epics can have something in common. 
Such a group of user stories is called a theme.

```
**Theme**   

* Upgrade functionalities  
```
Are large focus areas that span the organisation.
```
---
**Epic Story**      
```
An agile epic is a body of work that lasts longer than one iteration or can be broken down into user stories 
based on the needs/requests of customers or end users. Epics are a helpful way to organize your work and to create a 
hierarchy

```
* Create an aiport assistant to enhance user experience that enables the functionality of airport systems, enable 
efficient customer travel through user friendly interface. 


---
**User Stories**

```
Are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
```

1. As an airport Assistant I want to be able to create a passenger with a name and passport number, so I can add them 
to the flight

2. As an airport assistant I want to be able to create flight_trip with specific destination

3. As an airport Assistant I want to be able to assign and/or change a plane to my flight_trip, input my password so I 
can handle the problem

4. As an airport assistant I want to be able to add passengers to the flight_trip so that i can sell the tickets to them

5. As an airport assistant I want to be able to generate a flight_attendees_list_report that list of passengers and 
passports, so that i can check their identity document

# To do
method Ugne when you choose a location if it is a long haul it will assign the large plane 

if short haul assign small plane

add option to assign plane 

add while loop to booking



change user menu refactor the options to make sense

refactor option 1 - needs to draw from the database not from csv 

use data frames for options 2 and 3 

option 4 needs a change 

destination needs passenger id row + destination row concatinate the two together

destination already has the long or short haul assigned to it 

add to destination 

6 has to exit program with a message
